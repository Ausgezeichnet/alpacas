  <h1>Alpacas are some of the cutest animals that ever have and ever will live.</h1>
  <p>
    Alpacas live in the mountain ranges of South America. They are prized for their fiber, which is extremely soft and even reduces
    the humidity of the surrounding air. They are extremely adorable, and can range from tiny babies that look like stuffed
    animals to tall alpacas with big, goofy afros. I have created this webpage to show the awesomeness of
